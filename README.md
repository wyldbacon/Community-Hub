# Community-Hub
Community Hub is an open-source, user-owned social platform built for grassroots movements. It’s a place where neighbours, organisers and collectives create autonomous group spaces, organise real-world action, share resources, and pool funds — all without ads, surveillance, or opaque algorithms.

# The problems we solve

## 1. Big platforms work against communities
Mainstream social media harvests attention and data, fuels division, and optimises for engagement over outcomes.
Our response:
#### •	User ownership — people own their data and social graph, with the option to generate community funding from data sales.
#### •	Ad-free & algorithm-free — chronological or user-controlled feeds only.
#### •	Community governance — groups set their own rules; platform governance is open and auditable.
#### •	Privacy & safety — protective defaults for organisers and vulnerable members.

## 2. Grassroots organising is fragmented and vulnerable
Online Movements depend on commercial platforms that can de-platform them overnight, restrict their reach, or exploit their data. The result: fragile networks, constant churn between apps, and no long-term security for the communities themselves.
Our response:
#### •	Movement resilience — independent, open-source infrastructure that no corporation can shut down or exploit.
#### •	All-in-one organising hub — groups, events, resources, and funds in one space, designed for continuity.
#### •	Trust-first architecture — privacy, portability, and federation to keep communities safe and connected over time.

## 3. Platforms exploit value instead of sharing it
On corporate social media, all the value generated by communities — attention, data, content, networks — is captured by shareholders who have no stake in the community itself. Users create the wealth, but never share in it.
Our response:
#### •	Every user is a shareholder — ownership of Community Hub is distributed across the people who use it, not outside investors.
#### •	Community-backed value — the platform’s worth is built from two things: the shared values of the community, and the data users consciously choose to make public.
#### •	Fair returns — revenue streams (ads, ethical data licensing, or other services) include a community VAT system, where a small portion cycles back to all active users, ensuring the collective benefits from the collective’s activity.
