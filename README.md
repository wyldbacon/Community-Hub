# Community-Hub
Community Hub is an open-source, user-owned social platform built for grassroots movements. It’s a place where neighbours, organisers and collectives create autonomous group spaces, organise real-world action, share resources, and pool funds — all without ads, surveillance, or opaque algorithms.
